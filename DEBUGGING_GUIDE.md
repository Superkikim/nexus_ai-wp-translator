## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Translation Functionality Test
1. Go to any post/page edit screen
2. Look for "Translation Management" meta box
3. Select target languages and click "Translate Now"
4. Monitor browser console for debug messages
5. Check translation logs in admin dashboard

### 2. Language Detection Test
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Set browser language to a supported language (e.g., Spanish)
3. Visit the website
4. Verify automatic redirection to appropriate language version

### 3. Database Verification Test
1. Check WordPress database for plugin tables:
   - `wp_nexus_ai_wp_translations`
   - `wp_nexus_ai_wp_translation_logs`
   - `wp_nexus_ai_wp_user_preferences`
2. Verify logs are being created during translation attempts

### 4. API Integration Test
1. Go to Settings â†’ API Settings
2. Enter valid Anthropic API key
3. Click "Test Connection"
4. Verify models are loaded automatically
5. Check error logs for API communication issues

## Debug Mode Activation

Add these lines to `wp-config.php` for enhanced debugging:

```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
```

Check `/wp-content/debug.log` for detailed error messages.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors
**Solution**: Ensure user has `edit_posts` capability

### Issue: "Invalid nonce" errors  
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and reload admin page

### Issue: API connection failures
**Solution**: Verify API key and check server's ability to make HTTPS requests
