# WordPress Translation Plugin Analysis Report

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Translation Functionality Broken
**Problem**: The "Start Translation" button does nothing
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- JavaScript event handlers are properly bound in `assets/js/admin.js`
- AJAX endpoints exist in `includes/class-translation-manager.php`
- Issue likely in the translation workflow or API integration

### 2. Language Management System Issues
**Problem**: Language management is non-functional
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Frontend language detection exists but may have logic issues
- Browser locale detection implemented but not properly integrated
- Language switching mechanism exists but may have broken event handlers

### 3. Logging System Empty/Broken
**Problem**: No logs are being generated
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Database logging functions exist in `includes/class-database.php`
- Translation manager calls logging functions
- Issue may be in database table creation or log insertion

### 4. Default Language Loading Issues
**Problem**: Default language not properly set on plugin load
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Default language is hardcoded to 'en' in multiple places
- No mechanism to set admin-defined default language on activation

**Problem**: Articles not displaying in user's preferred language
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Frontend class has browser detection logic
